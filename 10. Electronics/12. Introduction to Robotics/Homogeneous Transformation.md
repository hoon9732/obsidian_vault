Absolutely! This slide explains a very important concept in **robotics** and **rigid body transformations**: **how to correctly compose homogeneous transformations** depending on the reference frame.

## 🔄 What's a Homogeneous Transformation?

A homogeneous transformation matrix $H \in \mathbb{R}^{4 \times 4}$ encodes:

* A **rotation** (via a 3×3 matrix)
* A **translation** (via a 3×1 vector)

It transforms a point from one coordinate frame to another.

## 🧭 What Are Fixed and Current Frames?

### **Fixed Frame (aka world frame, base frame)**

* The **global reference frame** (denoted $o_0$)
* It does **not move**
* Transformations defined in this frame are **absolute**

### **Current Frame (aka body frame, moving frame)**

* The **coordinate frame attached to the moving object**
* Transformations defined here are **relative** to the current orientation of the object

## 🔷 Slide Breakdown

### 🔹 1. **Post-Multiplication (Current Frame)**

$$
H_2^0 = H_1^0 \cdot H
$$

* You **already have** frame 1 relative to frame 0: $H_1^0$
* You apply a transformation $H$ **defined in frame 1** (the current frame)
* You multiply on the **right** → post-multiply

This is like:
**“Take the current pose, and move *relative to myself*”**

---

### 🔹 2. **Pre-Multiplication (Fixed Frame)**

$$
H_2^0 = H \cdot H_1^0
$$

* $H$ is defined **relative to the fixed frame**
* You apply a transformation as if saying:
  **“Apply this movement in the global frame first, then consider where frame 1 was”**

## 💡 Intuition: Order Matters

Homogeneous transformation matrices do **not commute**:

$$
AB \ne BA
$$

So **the order you apply motions in matters**, and it depends on **which frame you're using** as the reference.

## ✅ Summary Table

| Case                              | Reference Frame   | Transformation Form | Multiply      |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| Apply $H$ in local (body) frame   | **Current Frame** | $H_2^0 = H_1^0 H$   | Post-multiply |
| Apply $H$ in global (world) frame | **Fixed Frame**   | $H_2^0 = H H_1^0$   | Pre-multiply  |
