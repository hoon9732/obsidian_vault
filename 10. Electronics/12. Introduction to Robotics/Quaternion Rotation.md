These slides explain how to **convert between quaternions and rotation matrices**, which is a **common topic in robotics exams** involving 3D transformations, especially in kinematics, computer vision, or aerospace.

Hereâ€™s a clean, test-ready summary of each slide and how it might be asked in an exam:

---

### âœ… **Slide 1 (Quaternion to Rotation Matrix)**

**What it's about**:
Given a unit quaternion $q = [q_0, q_1, q_2, q_3]$, compute the equivalent 3Ã—3 rotation matrix.

**Formula (from expanding $q x q^*$)**:

$$
R =
\begin{bmatrix}
q_0^2 + q_1^2 - q_2^2 - q_3^2 & 2(q_1 q_2 - q_0 q_3) & 2(q_1 q_3 + q_0 q_2) \\
2(q_1 q_2 + q_0 q_3) & q_0^2 - q_1^2 + q_2^2 - q_3^2 & 2(q_2 q_3 - q_0 q_1) \\
2(q_1 q_3 - q_0 q_2) & 2(q_2 q_3 + q_0 q_1) & q_0^2 - q_1^2 - q_2^2 + q_3^2
\end{bmatrix}
$$

**Test-style questions**:

* Given $q$, compute the rotation matrix.
* Verify orthogonality of the resulting matrix.
* Derive the rotation matrix from a given quaternion by expanding $q x q^*$.

### âœ… **Slide 2 (Rotation Matrix to Quaternion: Diagonal Elements)**

**What it's about**:
Using the trace of rotation matrix $R$, compute squared quaternion terms:

$$
\begin{aligned}
q_0^2 &= \frac{1 + r_{11} + r_{22} + r_{33}}{4} \\
q_1^2 &= \frac{1 + r_{11} - r_{22} - r_{33}}{4} \\
q_2^2 &= \frac{1 - r_{11} + r_{22} - r_{33}}{4} \\
q_3^2 &= \frac{1 - r_{11} - r_{22} + r_{33}}{4}
\end{aligned}
$$

**Test-style questions**:

* Given a rotation matrix, compute $q_0$ or another component using diagonal terms.
* Use the trace to decide the dominant quaternion component.

### âœ… **Slide 3 (Rotation Matrix to Quaternion: Off-diagonal Elements)**

**What it's about**:
Relating quaternion products (like $q_0 q_1$) to **off-diagonal elements** of the rotation matrix:

$$
\begin{aligned}
q_0 q_1 &= \frac{1}{4}(r_{32} - r_{23}) \\
q_0 q_2 &= \frac{1}{4}(r_{13} - r_{31}) \\
q_0 q_3 &= \frac{1}{4}(r_{21} - r_{12}) \\
q_1 q_2 &= \frac{1}{4}(r_{12} + r_{21}) \quad \text{etc.}
\end{aligned}
$$

**Test-style questions**:

* Given rotation matrix $R$, compute all quaternion elements (not just squared ones).
* Solve a system of equations involving off-diagonal terms.
* Explain the relationship between symmetry of $R$ and the quaternion components.

### ðŸ§  Key Concepts for Test

| Concept                           | What to Know                                                         |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Quaternion to Rotation Matrix** | Use $q x q^*$ expansion, memorize matrix form                        |
| **Rotation Matrix to Quaternion** | Use trace (diagonal) and skew (off-diagonal) terms                   |
| **Ambiguity**                     | Quaternion signs are ambiguous: $q$ and $-q$ represent same rotation |
| **Conversion Process**            | If largest $q_i^2$, solve that one first, then derive others         |
| **Normalization**                 | Resulting quaternion should be unit norm                             |
|                                   |                                                                      |

* Convert a quaternion $q$ to rotation matrix $R$
* Prove $q x q^*$ results in a vector with no scalar component
* Discuss why both diagonal and off-diagonal terms are used
* Explain why only **one quaternion multiplication** isn't enough to rotate a vector in 3D
