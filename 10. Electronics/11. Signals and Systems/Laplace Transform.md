The **Laplace transform** is to continuous-time signals and systems what the Z-transform is to discrete time: it converts time-domain functions into an algebraic function of a complex variable $s$, turning differential equations into simple algebraic equations and convolution into multiplication. Here’s how it works:

---

## 1. Definition

For a (causal) signal $x(t)$, the **unilateral Laplace transform** is

$$
X(s) \;=\;\int_{0^-}^{\infty} x(t)\,e^{-st}\,dt,
$$

where $s = \sigma + j\omega$ is a complex variable.
The **bilateral** form extends the lower limit to $-\infty$.

## 2. Region of Convergence (ROC)

* The integral converges only for those $s$ whose real part $\Re\{s\}$ makes $\int |x(t)e^{-\sigma t}|\,dt$ finite.
* The set of such $s$ is the **ROC**, typically a half-plane $\Re\{s\} > \sigma_0$ (for right-sided signals) or $\Re\{s\} < \sigma_1$ (for left-sided signals), or an annulus for two-sided signals.
* **Causality** ↔ ROC is to the **right** of the rightmost pole.
* **Stability** ↔ ROC **includes** the $j\omega$-axis.

## 3. Key Properties

| Time-Domain Operation  | Laplace-Domain Result                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Linearity              | $a\,x(t)+b\,y(t)\to aX(s)+bY(s)$           |
| Differentiation in $t$ | $\frac{d}{dt}x(t)\to sX(s)-x(0^-)$         |
| Integration in $t$     | $\int_0^t x(\tau)d\tau\to \frac{1}{s}X(s)$ |
| Time-shift             | $x(t-t_0)u(t-t_0)\to e^{-s t_0}X(s)$       |
| Convolution            | $x(t)*h(t)\to X(s)\,H(s)$                  |
| Initial-value theorem  | $x(0^+)=\lim_{s\to\infty}sX(s)$            |
| Final-value theorem    | $\lim_{t\to\infty}x(t)=\lim_{s\to0}sX(s)$  |

## 4. Solving Differential Equations

1. **Transform** the ODE in $t$ to an algebraic equation in $s$ (accounting for initial conditions via the differentiation property).
2. **Solve** for $Y(s)$ in terms of $X(s)$; identify the system function $H(s)=Y(s)/X(s)$.
3. **Inverse-transform** $Y(s)$ back to $y(t)$ via partial fractions, tables, or residues.

## 5. Example

If $x(t)=e^{-at}u(t)$, then

$$
X(s)=\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-at}e^{-st}\,dt
=\frac{1}{s+a},\quad \Re\{s\}>-a.
$$

If the system is first order,
$\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dt}+by=x(t)$,
taking Laplace gives
$(sY(s)-y(0)) + bY(s)=X(s)$,
so

$$
Y(s)=\frac{X(s)+y(0)}{s+b}, 
$$

and you invert to get $y(t)$.
