Everything is working fine except for the contrail direction.
1. The contrail must be opposite to the missile velocity based on fixed map axes, but the direction seems to follow the missile orientation.

And now I need new features added.

2. This whole missile_sim.py code was intended as a submodule for the larger gui i've been making. The main.py code opens up gl_viewer.py module in the modules folder when btn_open_gl is clicked in gui. I want to connect the gui code to the missile_sim.py now. Tell me how I can seamlessly turn on missile_sim.py by pressing the same button in gui.
