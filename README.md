# ✍️ Obsidian Vault – Writing Ideas

Welcome to my personal **Obsidian Vault** dedicated to capturing, refining, and evolving my writing ideas.

This vault serves as a second brain—a structured playground where inspiration meets execution.

---

## 🗂 Structure

The vault is organized into the following key folders:

- `📒 Inbox`: Raw thoughts, quick notes, and fleeting ideas.
- `🧠 Concepts`: More developed themes and fragments for essays, stories, etc.
- `🧾 Drafts`: Drafted outlines and rough pieces.
- `📚 References`: Clippings, quotes, research, and useful external material.
- `✅ Final`: Polished and completed pieces.

> 📌 **Note:** Some folders may be hidden to keep the workspace clean.

## 🔄 Sync & Git

This vault is **version-controlled** using Git via the [Obsidian Git plugin](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git), allowing for:

- Safe backups of all ideas and writing
- Sync across machines
- Easy history tracking

To commit changes:
